The code in this directory was copied from the `tsify` crate, which is dual licensed under the MIT license and the Apache License 2.0.
Over time, this code will diverge from the original code sufficiently that the original license files will no longer be applicable.
Until that time, we will preserve the original license files in the `LICENSE_MIT` and `LICENSE_APACHE` files in this directory.

We appreciate the work of the `tsify` crate authors, and we thank them for their contributions to the Rust ecosystem.
