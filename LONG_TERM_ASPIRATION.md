# IN THE FAR FUTURE - after ankurah is fully working

THe hope is that we can continue to evolve Ankurah into a federated/distributed hypergraph database.

Intended features:

- Recording and querying time-series data for a given topic
- Representing and querying event-sourced state for a given topic
- Representing (hyper)edges which define relationships between topics (and embeddings)
  - Hybrid hypergraph/vector paradigm
- Declarative + recursive live-querying
- Multi-homed users which are able to roam between servers or self-host without
  loosing their data or their thought partners
